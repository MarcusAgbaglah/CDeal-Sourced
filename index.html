              <h3>THE CAFE</h3>
              <h2> South Wales</h2>
              <p>
                In the heart of scenic South Wales, I undertook a remarkable transformation, turning a neglected space into a cozy café.
                Armed with a vision and unwavering determination, I breathed life into the forgotten setting.
                The renovation brought out the space's rustic charm, with exposed brick walls and bespoke wooden furnishings.
                Local artisans and antique finds added character, while a mural painted by a talented local artist celebrated the region's beauty.
                With a menu featuring locally sourced ingredients and carefully crafted beverages, the café quickly became a beloved community gathering spot, blending the essence of South Wales into every cup and bite.

              <h3>One Bedroom</h3>
              <h2>South Wales</h2>
              <p>A ground floor property situated in the south of Wales.
                A cafe requires careful planning and consideration of several factors. Location is key, with a busy shopping street or popular tourist destination being ideal.
                The cafe's design should be comfortable and welcoming, with a well-equipped kitchen.
                All necessary permits and licenses should be obtained before opening, and marketing campaigns put in place to attract customers.
                Developing a menu that appeals to the target demographic is also essential.
                With hard work and planning, converting a ground floor property into a cafe can be a profitable business venture.
